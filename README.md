# Abstract

The stock market is subject to rapid changes. It is very difficult to predict what will happen to the stock market in general or the stocks of a particular company. A significant amount of money can be earned or saved when the stock market trend for the day itself or the next day can be predicted. In this project to predict future stock price we apply supervised learning algorithms using Scala and Spark.
